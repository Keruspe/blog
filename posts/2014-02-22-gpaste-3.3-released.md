It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste/gpaste-3.3.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

This is the last release supporting GNOME <3.10.

## What's new?

- New growing-lines feature (backported from 3.8)

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
