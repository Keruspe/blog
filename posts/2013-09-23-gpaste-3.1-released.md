It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste/gpaste-3.1.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

This release and the couple of following ones (3.2, maybe 3.3 and 3.4) are the last releases supporting GNOME <3.10.

3.2 will include a new setting to manage the maximum memory usage of GPaste, and some internal enhancement.

3.3 and 3.4 will be bugfixes/maintainance releases if needed.

This code is now managed in [the 3.0 branch of the GPaste repository](https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste/tree/3.0).

## What's new?

- Compatibility with gnome-shell up to 3.9.5
- New keybinding to sync the clipboard to the primary selection
- New keybinding to sync the primary selection to the clipboard

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
