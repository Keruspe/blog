## New Stuff

It's been a long time without posts. The previous blog was a bit heavyweight
and I did not have enough time to update it correctly.

This new blog will revolve around a few topics :

* Configuring my system (primarily aboout exherbo, systemd, xmonad)
* Stuff I learn at work (primarily about libraries / languages I work with)
* Stuff I learn during my free time (primarily papers / talks about FP and CS)
* Stuff I teach (mainly in French - sorry)
* Occasional rants (but I'll try to be nice)

## Please note:

This blog is proudly built using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html).
I basically took the `tagblog` example and customized a bit the templates.

I prefer spending time on Haskell rather than spending time on CSS, therefore
the design is quite… minimal. I'll try to improve it over time, but don't
expect too much.
