## What is creds? What is a credentials mangler?

You can see my complete article about this [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2016-02-07-creds-1-released.html).

## How do I get it?

creds is available [on github](https://github.com/Keruspe/creds)

Version 3 release tarball is available [here](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/creds/creds-3.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

## What's new in this release?

- don't require xsltproc and docbook-xsl when building a release
- support `CREDS_GPG_ARGS` environment variable to pass additional args to gpg
- don't crash on some commands when we do not have anything stored yet

I hope you'll enjoy it. Feel free to propose new features and/or to contribute!
