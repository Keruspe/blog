<h2 id="my-experience-and-evolution">My experience and evolution</h2>
<p>I am not a old great guru with a heavy beard using linux since the 90s. I started using computers quite late, back in year 2000 or such. My first computer was running Windows XP (yes, I know…). Believe it or not, at this time, my computer didn’t attract me at all and I did not want to know more of it.</p>
<p>A couple of years before taking my Bachelor degree, my maths teacher taught me how to write tiny programs to get stuff automatically done on a calculator. This introduction to software writing was like a revelation to me. I decided a few years after to start learning computer sciences, in 2007. I couldn’t stand using this crappy m$ thingie anymore, so I decided to install “linux”, understand “whatever GNU/Linux distribution one would recommend me.</p>
<p>This is how I started using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I stood with it for a little more than a year, starting to learn the basics. After that, I felt it was becoming ugly and sloooooow, so I decided to change. <a href="../posts/2012-12-10-knowing-your-system---part-3---source-based-distributions-the-gentoo-example.html">As I said before</a>, I then decided to give <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> a try, since I wanted to really start learning a system’s internals. It was quite a good choice and I really learnt a lot.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-to-exherbo">Contributing to Exherbo</h2>
<p>You know after I discovered (and then contributed) to <a href="http://paludis.exherbo.org/">paludis</a>, <a href="../posts/2012-12-27-knowing-your-system---part-6---source-based-distributions-discovering-exherbo.html">I decided to switch</a> to another source-based distribution: <a href="http://exherbo.org/">Exherbo</a>. If <a href="https://galileo.mailstation.de/egitstats/authors.html">statistics</a> are correct, I have contributed to Exherbo for the first time 743 days ago, at the time I’m writing this, which appears to be 2011, June the 25th. Not sure how long I had been using Exherbo before that though.</p>
<p>After 2 years and 1 day of contributions, discussions and support in the Exherbo community, I was finally asked on June, the 26th to join the team and become <a href="http://exherbo.org/developers.html">an official Exherbo developer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="becoming-an-exherbo-developer">Becoming an Exherbo developer</h2>
<p>Exherbo takes a huge place both in my hobbies since I love to contribute to it ( <a href="../posts/2013-01-17-knowing-your-system---part-9---contributing-to-exherbo:-updated-and-smoother-method.html">it’s really an easy thing to do</a>) and in my work. Some of my colleagues were running Gentoo on their laptops (which was a little because of me) and I felt quite sad for them, since their system broke quite often (so did mine when I was running Gentoo). With my shiny robust Exherbo system, I convinced them to switch, and they now are full Exherbo users too. Others are even currently switching too. This seem quite logical to us to use for production in <a href="http://www.clever-cloud.com/en/">our company</a> the distribution we know the best and we know that works the best, so we chose Exherbo. Regarding this both personal and professional involvement into the Exherbo community, I couldn’t say anything but “Yes, of course I’ll join you!”.</p>
<p>So here I am, Exherbo evangelist, and now official developer!</p>
