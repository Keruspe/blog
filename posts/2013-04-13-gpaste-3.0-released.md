Finally version 3.0 is there. It's lacking a few things that I wanted in, but I miss a lot of time these days, so I
postponed these for 3.1.

It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste-3.0.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

## What's new?

- Various build fixes
- Support of gnome-control-center for setting keybindings
- Compatibility with newer gnome-shell

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
