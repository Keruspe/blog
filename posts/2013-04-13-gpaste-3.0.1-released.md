The release tarball for 3.0 was corrupted, release 3.0.1 with a sane one.

It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste/gpaste-3.0.1.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

## What's new?

- Fix build

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
