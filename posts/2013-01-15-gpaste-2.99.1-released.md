Followup to [yesterday release](http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2013-01-14-gpaste-2.99-released.html), here is a
bugfix release getting a few cutting edge problems solved.

It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste-2.99.1.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

## What's new?

* Fix a few typos in the conditional code for applet and extension
* Fix make install when GPaste is not yet installed
* Clean desktop files

This is 3.0 RC2 and no major changes should append before the 3.0 release.

Feedback really appreciated!

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)


EDIT: packagers should backport <https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste/commit/61947fa2b5ea6b19b2a9cdb7db2b328e4a703f85> with
this release.
