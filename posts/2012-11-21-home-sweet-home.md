## Welcome

It has been a long time since I first wanted to get a blog.

I'll mostly speak here about free software and stuff I like to hack,
from sysadmin to development and debugging. I write code mostly in
Java for my job, but my language of choice is the C for my personal projects.
This is why this blog is written in haskell.

Just to be clear, what I mean by sysadmin is not 

    sudo apt-get install kde

I'm a source-based distributions enthusiast and prefer tutorials and tips
about raw software over distro-specific ones.

## Special thanks

This blog is powered by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/index.html).

It was written by [Cl√©ment Delafargue](https://clementd.cleverapps.io/posts/2012-10-21-blog-deployment-system.html)
and I shamelessly stole it from him.

This blog is available as [a git repository](http://github.com/Keruspe/blog)
and hosted on [The Clever Cloud](http://clever-cloud.com) which is the company I work for.
