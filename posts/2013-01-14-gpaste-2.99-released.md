It's available [there](https://github.com/downloads/Keruspe/GPaste/gpaste-2.99.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

I's still [hosted on github](https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste).

## What's new?

* Compatibility with recent development releases of gnome-shell
* "gpaste f" now defers the file reading to the GPaste daemon
* libgpaste-client does now fully cover the GPaste DBus API
* libgpaste-keybinder has been ported to use XInput2
* keybindings have been fixed
* The gnome-shell extension has been ported to use libgpaste-client
* A systemd user unit is now provided
* New library: libgpaste-settings-ui
* gpaste-settings has been ported to libgpaste-settings-ui
* The gnome-shell extension now has a pref.js module based on libgpaste-settings-ui
* An autostart desktop file is now provided with the legacy applet
* gobject-introspection and vala support are now optional

This is actually 3.0 RC and no major changes should append before the 3.0 release.

Feedback really appreciated!
