## My experience and evolution

I am not a old great guru with a heavy beard using linux since the 90s. I started using computers quite late, back in
year 2000 or such. My first computer was running Windows XP (yes, I knowâ€¦). Believe it or not, at this time, my computer
didn't attract me at all and I did not want to know more of it.

A couple of years before taking my Bachelor degree, my maths teacher taught me how to write tiny programs to get stuff
automatically done on a calculator. This introduction to software writing was like a revelation to me. I decided a few
years after to start learning computer sciences, in 2007. I couldn't stand using this crappy m$ thingie anymore, so I
decided to install "linux", understand "whatever GNU/Linux distribution one would recommend me.

This is how I started using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). I stood with it for a little more than a year, starting to
learn the basics. After that, I felt it was becoming ugly and sloooooow, so I decided to change.
[As I said before](http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2012-12-10-knowing-your-system---part-3---source-based-distributions-the-gentoo-example.html),
I then decided to give [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/) a try, since I wanted to really start learning a system's
internals. It was quite a good choice and I really learnt a lot. 

## Contributing to Exherbo

You know after I discovered (and then contributed) to [paludis](http://paludis.exherbo.org/),
[I decided to switch](http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2012-12-27-knowing-your-system---part-6---source-based-distributions-discovering-exherbo.html)
to another source-based distribution: [Exherbo](http://exherbo.org/). If [statistics](https://galileo.mailstation.de/egitstats/authors.html)
are correct, I have contributed to Exherbo for the first time 743 days ago, at the time I'm writing this,
which appears to be 2011, June the 25th. Not sure how long I had been using Exherbo before that though.

After 2 years and 1 day of contributions, discussions and support in the Exherbo community, I was finally asked on June,
the 26th to join the team and become [an official Exherbo developer](http://exherbo.org/developers.html).

## Becoming an Exherbo developer

Exherbo takes a huge place both in my hobbies since I love to contribute to it (
[it's really an easy thing to do](http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2013-01-17-knowing-your-system---part-9---contributing-to-exherbo:-updated-and-smoother-method.html))
and in my work. Some of my colleagues were running Gentoo on their laptops (which was a little because of me) and I felt
quite sad for them, since their system broke quite often (so did mine when I was running Gentoo). With my shiny robust
Exherbo system, I convinced them to switch, and they now are full Exherbo users too. Others are even currently switching
too. This seem quite logical to us to use for production in [our company](http://www.clever-cloud.com/en/) the distribution
we know the best and we know that works the best, so we chose Exherbo. Regarding this both personal and professional
involvement into the Exherbo community, I couldn't say anything but "Yes, of course I'll join you!".

So here I am, Exherbo evangelist, and now official developer!
