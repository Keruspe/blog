Followup to [last week's release](http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2013-01-15-gpaste-2.99.1-released.html), here is a
new bugfix release.

It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste/gpaste-2.99.2.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

## What's new?

* Fix a bug making gpaste settings ui a no-op
* Don't close legacy applet menu when deleting an item
* Fix vala bindings
* Updated portuguese translation

This is 3.0 RC3 and should be the latest RC before the 3.0 release.

Feedback really appreciated!

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
