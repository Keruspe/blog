It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste/gpaste-3.2.2.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

This release and the couple of following ones (3.3 and maybe 3.4) are the last releases supporting GNOME <3.10.

3.3 will add an ubuntu unity applet.

3.4 will be bugfixes/maintainance release if needed.

## What's new?

- "Paste and Pop" is now only "Pop"
- Fix SEGV at startup
- Fix SEGV when deleting last item of history

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
