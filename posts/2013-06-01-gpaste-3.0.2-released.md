It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste-3.0.2.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

## What's new?

- Fix build without gnome-control-center installed
- Fix focus when using &lt;Ctrl>&lt;Alt>&lt;H> in gnome-shel extension

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
