Blogging about my personal life is not one of my habits, but tonight is the exception, because it's worth it.

## Context

Since September, 2013, I'm living in Japan, near [Nagoya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya).

In Japan, there's a traditional kind of meal called [bento](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento).

A bento is basically a meal better served cold, often brought as a picnic or quick lunch, carried in a special box.

Japanese people really like so-called "cute" things and tend to make their bentos as artistic as possible, like some
kinds of paintings.

## Exherbo + bento = ?

Tonight, my girlfriend made me the surprise of cooking me the *geekest* bento ever.

[Exherbo](http://www.exherbo.org/)'s mascot: [2ebrapig](http://dev.exherbo.org/~zebrapig/) as a plate,
[github](https://github.com/)'s mascot: octocat as a desert.

Pure Japanese awesomeness.

`cave show keruspe` (the command line written under zebrapig outputs this, on my machine:
