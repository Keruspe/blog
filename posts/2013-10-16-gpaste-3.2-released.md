It's available [there](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/gpaste/gpaste-3.2.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

This release and the couple of following ones (3.3 and maybe 3.4) are the last releases supporting GNOME <3.10.

3.3 will add an ubuntu unity applet.

3.4 will be bugfixes/maintainance release if needed.

## What's new?

- Performance improvements
- Daemon now fully evenmential (no more polling, less power consuption)
- GPasteClipboard now has a "owner-change" signal similar to GtkClipboard's one
- Misc. bugfixes
- New setting to set the maximum amount of memory used by data in history
- FIFO mode has been dropped (lacking design)
- g\_paste\_history\_add is now transfer full

And don't forget to run `gpaste dr` aka `gpaste daemon-reexec` after upgrading GPaste to activate new functionalities ;)
