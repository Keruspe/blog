## What is facron?

A full description of facron is available in these two articles from 2012:

- <http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2012-12-04-facron-fanotify-cron-system.html>
- <http://www.imagination-land.org/posts/2012-12-07-facron-released.html>

## How do I get it?

facron is available [on github](https://github.com/Keruspe/facron)

1.0 release tarball is available [here](http://www.imagination-land.org/files/facron/facron-1.0.tar.xz), get it while it's hot!

You must have fanotify included in your kernel (most recent systems should have it by default).

## What's new in this release?

- fixed systemd unit
- `$*` stands for accessing process pid
- new internal counter with `$+` `$-` and `$=`
- customisable config file
- fix interaction with folders

I hope you'll enjoy it. Feel free to propose new features and/or to contribute !
