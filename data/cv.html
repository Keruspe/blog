    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      I'm passionate about low level stuff and the inner mechanisms powering operating systems.
      I've always been eager to go deeper and gather myself knowledge of how things actually work.
      I quickly jumped to Gentoo during college, then got around Exherbo to push my digging even further.
      All of my systems experimentation led me to contributing to lots of open source projects and ultimately towards rust.
    </p>

    <h2>Employment history</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>
        SRE
        <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/">Clever Cloud</a>
      </h3>

      <p class="time-period">2010-Present</p>

      <p>
        I co-founded Clever Cloud when I was still a student, working part-time
        at first to design the Platform as a Service. We started experimenting
        with existing technologies, but quickly understood that they weren't
        made to be tweaked as much as we would need them to and ended up writing our own
        in-house orchestrator.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the initial release in 2012, the platform had to scale with both the
        number of clients and their size expanding. I had to compromise between
        using existing initial code to its maximum capacity while rewriting parts
        in a way that it could absorb the new load and the future next increases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being there from the start, I quickly became one of the references with regards
        to the big picture of the infrastructure, and I onboarded people as the team grew.
        I tried to document things as much as possible, co-writing the documentation when possible
        with peers while explaining the concepts or procedure to them. This kind of "pair writing"
        allows for the documentation to be less biased and more accessible to others afterwards.
        Each time a new member arrived was a good opportunity to review the existing documentation
        and complete it with what's missing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maintenance of a huge infrastructure requires a lot of automation. With years of background
        maintaining our own, I expanded our tooling every time we faced some time-consuming tasks,
        be them basic setups or on-call interventions. Over the years, our platform grew a lot, and
        the number of critical alerts requiring manual intervention actually decreased overall thanks
        to such tooling, especially in the monitoring and recovery areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was employee representative for 3 years, allowing for employees to communicate better with
        the direction when there were problems for which they didn't want to expose themselves,
        allowing me to be a central part of the communication inside the company.

        Core developer for the Exherbo linux distribution. In charge of the GNOME desktop,
        the LLVM stack, rustc and all the things based on rust. I also managed software
        used by Clever Cloud either on public or private repositories and custom patches
        on top of the official packages.

    <h2>More Information</h2>

    <p>
      Having spent my whole career in a small company, I'm used to getting implicated
      in lots of areas requiring a precise view of the big picture in order to get the
      details of each component right.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have always loved to work on open source projects and built some of my own.
      While historically I mostly worked with Java, Ruby and shell scripts, I tried
      and push more rust in new projects and tooling and successfully pushed it in
      production in several places over the years. My oldest open source projects,
      such as GPaste (a clipboard manager for GNOME) are written in C, my more recent
      ones are written in rust, such as the lapin AMQP client (that I initially started
      with Geoffroy Couprie, a colleague of mine). I've been contributing less for the
      past few years in my spare time since I'm now father of three.
