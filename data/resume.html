    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      I'm passionate about low level stuff and the inner mechanisms powering operating systems.
      I've always been eager to go deeper and gather myself knowledge of how things actually work.
      I quickly jumped onto Gentoo during college, then got around Exherbo (another source-based Linux distribution) to push my digging even further.
      All of my systems experimentation led me to contributing to lots of open source projects and ultimately towards rust.
    </p>

    <h2>Open Source contributions</h2>

    <p>
      Being an Exherbo packager, I ended up contributing to a lot of software's build system and became
      highly familiar with most of them. I'm also used to contribute to software I use either directly
      or as dependencies of some of my projects. I got write access to the GNOME repositories this way.
      According to <a href="https://www.openhub.net/accounts/Keruspe">OpenHub</a> I contributed to 215 open source
      projects.

      <li>Germinal is a terminal emulator I wrote (in C) to better suit my day to day terminal usage</li>

    <h2>More Information</h2>

    <p>
      Having spent my whole career in a small company, I'm used to getting implicated
      in lots of areas requiring a precise view of the big picture in order to get the
      details of each component right.
